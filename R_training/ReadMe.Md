### The R_training folder includes all Charley's R-scripts related to the Genomics Program Omics Hub's RNAseq data-analysis workshop. All tutorials are provided in two formats: ###

   **(1)** as *R-markdown files (extension .Rmd)*, which you can view and run interactively in RStudio, and
    
   **(2)** completed .html files created from each markdown which can be opened with any internet browser.
   
   You should be able to run these tutorials interactively if you participated in the RNAseq data-analysis workshop (all necessary programs should already be installed). Remember that any referenced filepaths need to be changed to your own.
