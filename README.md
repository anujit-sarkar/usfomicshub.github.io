Hello! You may have noticed that the repos has been changed quite a bit. This theme is forked from the [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) theme
which you can check out to see how this repos works. You can also email me for any changes to the site! -JD 

The old repos can be found [here](https://usf.box.com/s/ttelspvcsbo8mfsuwv66sgozd90ix3k1).

## This repos is for the OmicsHub GitPage. All workshop materials(scripts, tutorial screenshots, slides, etc.) are in their own workshop repository. Other supporting images and knitted markdowns are in this repos.
