This theme is forked from the [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) theme,
which you can check out to see how this repo works. Any Hub members wanting to update content should make their own fork, make their changes and submit a pull-request to minimize conflicts. Ask JO if you have questions.


## This repo is for the OmicsHub website. All workshop materials(scripts, tutorial screenshots, slides, etc.) are in their own workshop repository. Other supporting images and knitted markdowns are in this repo.
