USF Omics Hub official github-repository: your landing-spot for finding our USF Genomics community-resources.

Hello! You may have noticed that the repos has been changed quite a bit. This theme is forked from the [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) theme
which you can check out to see how this repos works. You can also email me for any changes to the site! -JD 

The old repos can be found [here](https://usf.box.com/s/ttelspvcsbo8mfsuwv66sgozd90ix3k1).
