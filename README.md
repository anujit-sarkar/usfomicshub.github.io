## This repo is for the OmicsHub website. All workshop materials(scripts, tutorial screenshots, slides, etc.) are in their own workshop repository. Other supporting images and knitted markdowns are in this repo. 

This theme is forked from the [minimal mistakes](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/) theme,
which you can check out to see how this repo works. Any Hub members wanting to update website content should make their own fork, make their changes and submit a pull-request to minimize conflicts. Ask JO if you have questions.
