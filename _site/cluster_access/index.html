<p>USF Genomics researchers requiring high-performance computing have two primary cluster-computing options (both maintained by USF Research Computing):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Research-Restricted Access cluster (RRA)</strong>, to which USF Genomics Program members have priority access, and</li>
<li><strong>CIRCE</strong>, the primary cluster servicing all USF researchers.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<h2 id="whats-the-difference-and-which-one-do-i-use">What's the difference, and which one do I use?</h2>
<p>Both clusters have excellent capabilities. As the name implies, <strong>RRA</strong> has stringent security measures in place to limit access and to protect potentially-sensitive human-subjects data. <em>Your research does not NEED to include HIPAA-protected data for you to use RRA.</em> Everybody requesting an RRA-account will, however, need to obtain HIPAA-training before their account can be created. Jobs run on RRA typically have faster turnaround-time as it is currently at lower utilization.</p>
<p>The <strong>CIRCE</strong> cluster, on the other hand, does not have as many restrictions on access and does not require additional certification for account-creation. Wait-times for job completions using CIRCE are likely to be longer due to much-higher utilization.</p>
<p>Please follow the instructions below to gain access to the appropriate cluster. Once the requirements have been satisfied, Research Computing is typically very quick to create your account.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="creating-an-rra-cluster-account">Creating an RRA Cluster Account</h2>
<br>
<p>To request an RRA-Cluster account, email <a href="mailto:help@usf.edu">help@usf.edu</a> <em><strong>from your official USF email address</strong></em> with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting USF Faculty-member full name</li>
<li>Supporting USF Faculty-member email address</li>
</ul>
<p>Once contacted, RC administrators will send over all applicable SabaCloud/Docusign links/information, which will include instructions for completing your online HIPAA-certification. Note that <strong>HIPAA Training is <em>required</em> for access to the Genomics RRA cluster.</strong></p>
<p><em>If you or your supporting USF Faculty member are <strong>NOT</strong> listed on the <a href="https://health.usf.edu/publichealth/ghidr/genomics/researchers">USF Genomics Faculty page</a>, please email <a href="mailto:genomics@usf.edu">genomics@usf.edu</a> for clearance <strong>BEFORE</strong> requesting an account.</em></p>
<br>
<p><em><strong>All RRA accounts are automatically granted access to CIRCE. If requesting an RRA account, do not send in a request for a CIRCE account as well.</strong></em></p>
<br>
<br>
<h2 id="creating-a-circe-account">Creating a CIRCE account</h2>
<br>
<p>To request a CIRCE account, email <a href="mailto:help@usf.edu">help@usf.edu</a> <em><strong>from your official USF email address</strong></em> with the following information:</p>
<ul>
<li>Supporting USF Faculty-member full name</li>
<li>Supporting USF Faculty-member email address</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>NOTE: Only send a request for a CIRCE account if you do not currently have (or are not actively requesting) an RRA account.</strong></em></p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<p>You can refer to <a href="https://wiki.rc.usf.edu/index.php/Main_Page">Research Computing's documentation-wiki</a> for further information on HPC-basics, CIRCE hardware and other useful topics. Refer to <a href="https://github.com/usfomicshub/usfomicshub.github.io/blob/master/wiki/markdowns/facilities_and_resources.md">our Genomics Facilities and Resources</a> for information on RRA hardware and specifications.</p>
