GOAL
> This training course includes presentations on  technology theory  and practical experience with  the entire laboratory  sample prep workflow.  Experienced trainers will lead you through  using TapeStationand Miseqequipment.  By the end  of this training, participants will be able to  complete the  Illumina library preparation process and set up a sequencing run  using Illumina MiseqControl  Software.

⬣ [Overview of Illumina NGS Library Preparation Workflow](https://www.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/beginners/ngs-workflow.html) Overview of Illumina NGS library preparation workflows include understanding the basics of NGS chemistry, library multiplexing and the difference between the library preparations in all NSG methods such as whole genome sequencing (WGS), targeted sequencing (16s sequencing or exome seq), RNA sequencing, Methylation sequencing and ChIP sequencing, etc. 

⬣ [Understanding Illumina SBS Technology](https://www.illumina.com/science/technology/next-generation-sequencing/sequencing-technology.html)Sequencing by Synthesis (SBS) technology uses four fluorescently labeled nucleotides to sequence the tens of millions of clusters on the flow cell surface in parallel. During each sequencing cycle, a single labeled dNTP is added to the nucleic acid chain, after dNTP incorporation, the fluorescent dye is identified through laser excitation and imaging, then enzymatically cleaved to allow the next round of incorporation. Base calls are made directly from signal intensity measurements during each cycle.
