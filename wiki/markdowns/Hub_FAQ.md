<h1 style align="center">USF Omics Hub Frequently-Asked Questions</h1>

## What is the purpose of the Hub?

* Our primary mission is to help build LONG-TERM, extramurally-funded research programs for USF Genomics and to support the USF community by facilitating cutting-edge omics research. 
***

## Who are the people of the Hub?

* We are a small, interdisciplinary team of PhD-level biologists, bench scientists, bioinformaticians, programmers, statisticians, and scientific-writing experts here to help you design experiments, generate preliminary data, and collaborate with you to facilitate your omics research and strengthen the USF Genomics Program.

* We are also employed full-time as researchers on various extramurally-funded projects. **We continue to build our careers through these as well as collaborative projects initiated through the Hub.**

## What is included in consultation, and when would I have to start paying?
* Once we receive your request, we schedule an approximately one-hour meeting with you to discuss your needs and how we can fulfill them. The content of this initial meeting will vary by request: for example if you are seeking quotes for sequencing and/or analysis and other details for a grant-application, you will meet with our Core Facility expert and lead data scientist/grant-writing expert. If you are developing an experimental plan or looking for trouble-shooting help on existing projects or analyses, you will meet with our Brain Trust of widely-experienced data-scientists who can offer you advice and ideas. We work with you.

* After the initial consultation, a Service Plan will be made by the consultant for the client to approve or change. Included in this Service Plan will be any services requested and an estimated timeline for services to be provided. All work beyond the initial 4 hours of consultation (including preparation of the Service Plan) will be invoiced. You will be notified before time becomes billable.

## Why can't you just be free forever?

* We are all scientists, and in a perfect world, the Spirit of Discovery would be the sole reason for our existence. However! The Spirit of Discovery must ultimately be sustained by grant-money, and as such, our primary purpose is to facilitate high-caliber omics research to build a nationally-competitive Program for securing this funding. 

* Our Core was established with University funds as an investment in the future and growth of USF Genomics. Thanks to this support, we're currently able to provide select services/workshops (RNAseq training, Microbiome data-analysis training) for free to our USF community, as well as initial hours of consultation on omics-related projects per USF PI. Through these initiatives just over the past year, we've already seen promising Community engagement (from PI's, staff, and trainees), productive interdisciplinary collaborations, and a number of successful intra- and extramurally-funded proposals.

* As an academic institutional Core, The USF Genomics Facility and Omics Hub consulting services are not actually allowed to make profit. And don't worry, we don't! We do, however, need to recoup a percentage of operating-costs to continue to justify our existence and ensure continued availability of these resources.

## About how much money should I expect to allot for data analyses in my budget-planning?

* **Rule of thumb: you should expect to budget around the same amount for data-analysis as you do for sequencing.** More accurate estimates will be provided upon consultation and our suggested data-analysis plan--including the people and time required.

## That sounds like a lot of money! How much work could it really be for you to push some buttons and give me an answer?

* It is a common misconception among laboratory scientists that because everybody has a computer, data-scientists already have pre-defined methods/programs into which any data can be plugged, and sensible biological conclusions simply fall out. While it is sometimes possible to push buttons without knowing what you are doing to generate an "answer"--we don't recommend this approach, and most of the time it doesn't work that way! 

* Quality computational data-analyses are produced no more magically than wet-lab experimental results. If you are a lab-scientist, consider your own experience at the bench and the importance of thoughtful, reasoned experimental design (among other essential components, such as training and technical skill). So it is with computational analyses--there is no substitute for understanding your scientific question and designing the most appropriate experiment, using the most appropriate tools and methodologies (or creating new tools and methodologies when the need arises!), to answer your questions.

* There are some cases where one-size-fits-all data-analysis may be suitable for your purposes, and there are many fine bioinformatic for-profit, fee-for-service companies that can provide those analyses for you. Our focus as an academic institution is to educate you, provide context for our methods, and if needed, help you interpret your data biologically. The breadth of our experience as computational scientists, bench-scientists, and above all biologists makes us effective collaborators, and we are invested in the success of our USF Genomics Research Community.
