# USF Research Computing Cluster Account Requirements/Process

USF Genomics researchers requiring high-performance computing have two primary cluster-computing options (both maintained by USF Research Computing): 
* **The Research-Restricted Access cluster (RRA)**, to which USF Genomics Program members have priority access, and 
* **CIRCE**, the primary cluster servicing all USF researchers. 

## What's the difference, and which one do I use?
Both clusters have excellent capabilities. As the name implies, **RRA** has stringent security measures in place to limit access and to protect potentially-sensitive human-subjects data. _Your research does not NEED to include HIPAA-protected data for you to use RRA._ Everybody requesting an RRA-account will, however, need to obtain HIPAA-training before their account can be created. Jobs run on RRA typically have faster turnaround-time as it is currently at lower utilization. 

The **CIRCE** cluster, on the other hand, does not have as many restrictions on access and does not require additional certification for account-creation. Wait-times for job completions using CIRCE are likely to be longer due to much-higher utilization.

Please follow the instructions below to gain access to the appropriate cluster. Once the requirements have been satisfied, Research Computing is typically very quick to create your account (< 1 day).

## Creating an RRA Cluster Account

<br>

* If you or your supporting USF Faculty member are **NOT** listed on the [USF Genomics Faculty page](https://health.usf.edu/publichealth/ghidr/genomics/researchers), please email usfgenomics@usf.edu for clearance **BEFORE** requesting an account.

<br>

_**HIPAA Training is *required* for access to the Genomics RRA cluster**_

### 1. Log in to the https://usf.sabacloud.com site.

   * If you do not have an existing login, send an email to support@health.usf.edu to request SABA registration. Make a note that it is for required HIPAA training modules for REDCap access.

### 2. After logging in, use the search bar at the top for the Learning Catalog.

### 3. Access and complete the following modules.

 * HIPAA Privacy at USF
   
 * Code of Conduct
   
 * Computer and Information Security

### 4.  When you have finished, please generate PDF copies of the completion certificates for all 3 modules and include them in an email to Research Computing at rc-help@usf.edu with the subject “RRA Account Request”. 
   
   * If you are not a faculty member, please also provide the name and email address of your faculty sponsor in the email.

### 5.  Research Computing will then send you a security agreement via DocuSign that you will need to review and sign electronically. Once your information is verified they will create your account.

## Creating a CIRCE account
<br>

### 1.  Go to https://cwa.rc.usf.edu/ and login with NetID and password.

### 2.	Send email to rc-help@usf.edu with the subject "CIRCE Account Request". 
   
   * If you are not a faculty member, please also provide the name and email address of your faculty sponsor in the email.

### 3.	Research Computing will create your account on CIRCE once your information is verified.
