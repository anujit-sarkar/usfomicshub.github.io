# USF Research Computing Cluster Account Requirements/Process

USF Genomics researchers requiring high-performance computing have two primary cluster-computing options (both maintained by USF Research Computing): 
* **The Research-Restricted Access cluster (RRA)**, to which USF Genomics Program members have priority access, and 
* **CIRCE**, the primary cluster servicing all USF researchers. 

## What's the difference, and which one do I use?
Both clusters have excellent capabilities. As the name implies, **RRA** has stringent security measures in place to limit access and to protect potentially-sensitive human-subjects data. _Your research does not NEED to include HIPAA-protected data for you to use RRA._ Everybody requesting an RRA-account will, however, need to obtain HIPAA-training before their account can be created. Jobs run on RRA typically have faster turnaround-time as it is currently at lower utilization. 

The **CIRCE** cluster, on the other hand, does not have as many restrictions on access and does not require additional certification for account-creation. Wait-times for job completions using CIRCE are likely to be longer due to much-higher utilization.

Please follow the instructions below to gain access to the appropriate cluster. Once the requirements have been satisfied, Research Computing is typically very quick to create your account.

## Creating an RRA Cluster Account

<br>

To request an RRA-Cluster account, email rc-help@usf.edu *from your official USF email address* with the following information:

  * Supporting USF Faculty-member full name
  * Supporting USF Faculty-member email address
  
Once contacted, RC administrators will send over all applicable SabaCloud/Docusign links/information, which will include instructions for completing your online HIPAA-certification. Note that **HIPAA Training is *required* for access to the Genomics RRA cluster.**

*If you or your supporting USF Faculty member are **NOT** listed on the [USF Genomics Faculty page](https://health.usf.edu/publichealth/ghidr/genomics/researchers), please email genomics@usf.edu for clearance **BEFORE** requesting an account.*
    
<br>
 ***All RRA accounts are automatically granted access to CIRCE. If requesting an RRA account, do not send in a request for a CIRCE account as well.***

## Creating a CIRCE account
<br>

To request a CIRCE account, email rc-help@usf.edu *from your official USF email address* with the following information: 
   
  * Supporting USF Faculty-member full name
  * Supporting USF Faculty-member email address


***NOTE: Only send a request for a CIRCE account if you do not currently have (or are not actively requesting) an RRA account.***
