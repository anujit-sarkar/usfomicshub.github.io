<h2>The USF Codeathon has begun! Join us <a href="https://www.airmeet.com/e/6c1e1bc0-4396-11eb-bd6c-597038b87a94">here</a></h2>

## Updates:

### February 24 
Presentations from the Keynote Symposium will be made available here.

### January 19
If you missed the USF Intro to Codeathons Genomics Forum, you can catch up [here](https://web.microsoftstream.com/video/3b8fb3f6-a89b-4f10-b2e1-3bc338acc076).

## Main Objectives: 

⬣ What host, viral, or environmental factors are predictive of pandemic emergence and spread in different populations?

⬣ How can complex data-sources be integrated to create tools for public health intervention?

⬣ What are the urgently needed ‘dream applications’ for future pandemic prevention and management?

## Possible Team Projects 

- **Social Cost** a tool to register social and emotional cost of pandemics. Pandemics have extracted a health toll not only in human physical health, but also in emotional and social health. A tool to monitor, register and quantify social cost of large epidemics is needed

- **Viral Discovery and Surveillance** zoonotic viruses have a large reservoir with directly (viral or metagenomic databases) or indirectly (animal or human tissues) related to viruses, which may have been deposited in various databases. A tool of effectively mining through these databases and exploring the hidden viral diversity is needed. 

- **Host Genetics** efficient interrogation of human variants for disease outcomes. The viral infection outcome varies radically in terms of host co-morbidity, age, ethnicity, and other factors including human genetic variation. 

- **Nonhuman Host Susceptibility** prediction of selection pressures on other mammalian hosts and potential disease evolution. In the wake of Denmark’s experience with the so-called “Cluster 5” of SARS-CoV-2 in mink farms, it is of interest and in the theme of One Health to evaluate potential reverse zoonotic disease transmission.

- **Genetic Evolution of Human Pathogens** many RNA viruses are important human pathogens. RNA viruses generally have high mutation rates because of the lack of proofreading ability of their RNA polymerases. This mutation can also affect the protective efficacy of vaccines. Bioinformatics can be utilized to monitor genetic evolution of emerging and existing human RNA viruses.

- **Virus and Human Interactions** explore the relationship between human virome and respiratory diseases. Human airways are colonized by many viruses not only causing acute symptomatic infections, but also without causing clinical symptoms. It will be necessary to define the virome in the human respiratory tract and to evaluate the effects of viral infections on the dynamics of lung diseases. 

- **Microbiome and Infections Diseases** introduce how the microbiome can impact the susceptibility to and severity of infectious diseases. What technologies can be applied and what are the available platforms of bioinformatics for infections diseases?

- **Respiratory Microbiome** interrogate and explore air-borne microbiome diversities. There are myriads of microbes circulating in the air globally, including hundreds of respiratory viruses that occupy indoor spaces and public transportations. 

- **Sewage Microbiome Mining** mining and searching for potential pathogens. Many human viruses, including SARS-CoV-2, are able to replicate in the gastrointestinal track epithelial, and occur in human sewage systems. Efficient tools of monitoring the system and detecting potential pathogens can be used as part of urban health surveillance. 

- **Spatial-Temporal Prediction Models for COVID 19**  building spatial temporal prediction models using reputable data sources of COVID 19 daily cases and deaths. Perform model assessments including prediction accuracy, cross-validation, performance in the presence of change points.
