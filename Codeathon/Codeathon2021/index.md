## USF Codeathon 2021 will be held February 24-26, 2021. We will update this page during the event. 

## Main Objectives: 

⬣ What host, viral, or environmental factors are predictive of pandemic emergence and spread in different populations?

⬣ How can complex data-sources be integrated to create tools for public health intervention?

⬣ What are the urgently needed ‘dream applications’ for future pandemic prevention and management?
