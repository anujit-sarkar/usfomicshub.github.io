# Getting set up to access USF's commputational resources from home #

USF just switched from Junos Pulse to Global Protect VPN, which you'll need to download and get working in order to access the RRA cluster.
Follow the instructions [here](https://www.usf.edu/it/documentation/virtual-private-network.aspx) to get connected.

# Common issues #

If you are using a Mac and can't connect to the VPN--make sure your Mac is completely updated to Catalina and that you have followed the prompts to adjust your system preferences to accept downloads from third-party developers.
