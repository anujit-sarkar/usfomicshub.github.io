### WHO ARE THE PEOPLE OF THE HUB?

We are a small, interdisciplinary team of PhD-level biologists, bench scientists, bioinformaticians, programmers, statisticians, and scientific-writing experts here to help you design experiments, generate preliminary data, and collaborate with you to facilitate your omics research and strengthen the USF Genomics Program.

### WHAT ARE YOUR OTHER SERVICES? 

We are also employed full-time as researchers on various extramurally-funded projects. We continue to build our careers through these as well as collaborative projects initiated through the Hub. Please see our main [USF Genomics Hub Services](https://health.usf.edu/publichealth/ghidr/genomics/request-services) page to request computational assistance.
